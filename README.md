# Haskell Stuff

This repo is a collection of notes, snippets, and prototypes. Don't expect anything here to work that well.

Resources used:
- [https://gumroad.com/l/haskellbook](Haskell Programming from first principles) Super awesome book, very logic heavy but helps establish a solid foundation
- [http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters](Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!) More example-based, approachably written
- [http://book.realworldhaskell.org/](Real World Haskell) A sort of mixture of the previous two. Focuses mostly on working with data & IO; It also has user comments, which can be very useful
- [http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/](What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell) Amazing resource that covers some of the things that the other books miss
