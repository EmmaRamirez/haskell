## Functions

```
int x;
x : int
```

Variable x has type int, versus x is a member of the set of int.
Types & sets are almost the same thing.

`x:int` is an assertion that x is a member of int.

`int f(int x)`
`f :int -> int` a function being a thing that takes in an int and gives you an int.

`x:a` asserts x has type a
`f : a -> a` takes an a and gives you an a

`static a f<a> (a x)` short hand for a generic type

`g : a -> a`
How do we combine f and g?

## Monoids

```
f(g(a))
g(f(a))
f (g a)
g (f a)
```
*synonyms* = funciton application
**currying** = functions of multiple arguments, what we try to avoid in above

```
(f ~ g) = h : a -> a
```
Took two functions and created a new function of the same type. Also known as a **monoid**. Two things of the same type that create a thing of the same type.

The way to control complexity is compositionality.

A # of smaller 'simpler' things joined together.

It means you can change components without destroying them. Correct by construction.

Clock example: A monoid is a collection of things plus a rule for combining the things and that rule obey some rules.

Numbers on a clock form a monoid
(x + y) % 12
You can take any two numbers and you get a number.
(x + ( y + z)) = (x + y) + z
Must satisfy this rule.

Monoid must contain a special member such that x + 12 = x && 12 + x = x
A monoid *does not have to follow communitivity**

f (g a) =/= g (f a)

A monoid is a simple concept for a set of things.

Two meta rules: associativity and existence of a unit or zero (generically or abstractly).

## functions
If you have two f's that don't form a singular type, they are part of a monoidal category, but not a monoid.

(f ~ g) ~ h = f ~ (g ~ h)

f (g (h a))
f (g (h a)) = No way function composition cannot be associative.

```
id : a -> a
id a = a
(f ~ id) = f (id a) = f a
```
Functions under composition are a monoid.

## Monads
```
x: a
f : a -> Ma
g : a -> Ma
h : a -> Ma
```
Returns a transform of a.

Functions that take a's and return M of a's. *M* is a type constructor. Every function will take a and return a with some extra data to it. *M* is same for every compositional function.

```
a => .... --anonymous function expression
Î» --lambda
\a -> ... --haskell notation
```
The function of a that does etc.

No end of complexity. Linq is monadic. Designed by Meyer.

If I can get to compositionality. Functions under composition is monoid.

```
\a -> (f a) >>= \a -> (g a)
```
What's the type of f of a? Ma (a transformation of a). (g a)'s type is also Ma.

Why don't we just write it as g? Lambda does nothing other than call g on a.

We have to take (f a) and shove that in.

The composition of these two functions is a function that takes an a and returns an Ma.

Lambda expression with a bind expression.

The result of the entire thing is Ma.

```
\a -> (f a) >>= \a -> (g a)
```

Analog of composition so it has to observe associativity.

```
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

Maybe represents a type that may fail to return a result. The Maybe type suggests a strategy for combining computations which return Maybe alues. If a combined computation consist of one computation B that depends on the result of another computation A, then the combined computation should yield Nothing whenever A or B yield nothing and the combined computation should yield the result of B applied to the result of A when both succeed.

Monads may exist for I/O, have state, may return multiple results, etc.

## Why should I understand Monads?

Monads play a central role in I/O in Haskell. It is not essentail to understand Monads to do I/O in Haskell, but understanding I/O monads will improve your code.

1. Modularity -- they allow computations to be composed from simpler computations and separate the combination strategy from the actual computations being performed.
2. Flexibility -- they allow functional programs to be much more adaptable than equivalent programs written without monads. This is because the monad distills the computational strategy into a single place instead of requiring it be distributed through the entire program.
3. Isolation -- they can be used to create imperative-style computational structures which remain safely isolated from the main body of the functioanl program. This is used for incorporating side-effects such as I/O and state (which violates referential transparency) into a pure functional language like Haskell.

### Type Constructors
A *type constructor* is a parameterized type definition used with polymorphic types. By supplying a type constructor with one or more concrete types, you can construct a new concrete type in Haskell. In the definition of Maybe:

```
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

Maybe is a type constructor, Nothing and Just a are data constructors. You can construct a data value by applying the Just data constructor to a value.

```
country = Just "China"
```

In the same way, you can contruct a type by applying the Maybe type constructor to a type.

```
lookupAge :: DB -> String -> Maybe Int
```

polymorphic types are like containers that are capable of holding values of many different types. So Maybe Int can be thought of as a Maybe container holding an Int value (or Nothing) and Maybe String would be a Maybe container holding a String value (or Nothing).

In Haskell, we make the type container polymorphic so we could writing "m a" to represent a container of some type holding a value of some type.

"kind errors" indicate that you are not using the type constructors correctly.

### Maybe a monad
In Haskell, a monad is represented as a type constructor (call it m), a function that builds values of that type (a -> m a), and a function that combines values of that type with computations that produce values of that type to produce a new computation for values of that type (m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b). Not that the container is the same, but the type of the contents of the container can change. It is customary to call themonad type constructor "m" when discussing monads in general. The function that builds the values of that type is traditionally called "return" and the third function is known as "bind" but is written as `>>=`. The signatures of the function are:

```Haskell
-- type of monad m
data m a = ...
-- return is a type constructor that creates a monad isntance
return :: a -> m a
-- bind is a function that combines a monad instance m a with a computation
-- that produce another monad instance m b from a's to produce a new
-- monad instance m b
(>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```

Roughly speaking, the monad type constructor defines a type of computation, the return function creates primitive values of that computation type and >>= combines computations of that type together to make more complex computations of that type.

The `>>=` function takes the value from a monad container and passes it to a function to produce a monad container containing a new value, possibly a different type.

The `>>=` is known as bind because it binds the value in a monad container to the first argument of a function. By adding logic to the binding function, a monad can implement a specific strategy for combining computations in the monad.
