# Algebraic Data Types

## Algebraic datatypes

Writing your own data types can help leverage Haskell's powerful features -- pattern matching, type checking, inference

A type can be thought of as an enumeration of constructors that have zero or more arguments. 

Haskell offers:
- sum types
- type aliases
- newtype

## Data and type constructors

There are type constructors & data constructors

Types are static and resolve at compile

Data constructors construct the values at term level, values you can interact with at runtime

Constructor is often used to describe all type constructors and data constructors, we can make a distinction between constants and constructors
