# What is Haskell?
- A purely functional programming language.
  - Not like imperative, which relies on executions of a specific sequence of tasks.
  - Don't tell it what to do, but rather what stufff is.
  - Functions don't have side effects--they just return a value.
  - **Referential transparency**: a function can be called multiple times and return the same result, allowing the compiler to reason about the program and prove that a function is "correct."
- Haskell is lazy.
  - It won't execute functions unless it's forced to.
  - Programs are a series of **transformations on data.**
- Statically typed
  - Types are declared--i.e. a string or a number.
    - Possible errors are caught at compile time.
  - Type inference system
    - Don't have to explicitly label every piece of code with a type because the system can figure it out.
- Elegant and concise
  - Haskell tends to be shorter because it uses a lot of high level concepts.
- Made by Academics
- What you need
  - A compiler &amp; a text editor.
